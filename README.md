Website providing you with random lewd nsfw neko pics using [Nekos.life API](https://github.com/Nekos-life/Nekos-Sharp)

## Developement

#### I appreciate any contribution to the website! If you have an idea, implement it or ask me to do it! ^^

This website was created using [Blazor Server](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) in [.NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0).

### Libraries used
* [Nekos-Sharp](https://github.com/Nekos-life/Nekos-Sharp)
* [Blazored.LocalStorage](https://github.com/Blazored/LocalStorage)

### For the development you need
* [.NET IDE](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/tools)
* [.NET 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)

Clone the repo into your IDE. Make sure that all libraries are downloaded. Now you should already be able to start the website locally.

All the logic is done in [Index.razor](https://github.com/MarkenJaden/Nekos/blob/master/Nekos/Pages/Index.razor) and is not very complicated.

The rest of the application you don't really need to pay attention to, unless you want to add a bigger feature, but with such ambition I assume you have the necessary knowledge.

Once you're happy with your change you can just open a pull request, I'll take a quick look over it, and thanks to GitHub Actions your changes are live on the website just a few minutes later, it's really not hard :)

**If there are any questions you can always reach me via Discord (MarkenJaden#7787) ^^**
